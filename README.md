# Tic Tac Toe Game 🎮

A simple browser-based Tic Tac Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features ✅
- Login with a username
- Choose between `Play with Friend` or `Play with Computer` modes
- Responsive UI and simple game logic with win/draw detection
- Reset and return to menu options

## Files 🔧
- `index.html` — Main HTML file
- `styles.css` — Extracted styles
- `script.js` — Game logic and interactions

## Run locally ▶️
1. Open `index.html` directly in your browser (double-click the file).
2. Or use a live server for better dev experience (VS Code Live Server extension):
   - Install the Live Server extension in VS Code
   - Right-click `index.html` → "Open with Live Server"
3. Alternatively, use Python's simple HTTP server:
   ```bash
   # Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   # then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
   ```

If you'd like, I can add badges, a CONTRIBUTING.md, or convert the project to use a build step (minification, linting).
